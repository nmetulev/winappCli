.SYNOPSIS
    Install MSIX package and its certificate
.DESCRIPTION
    This script extracts and installs the certificate from an MSIX package to the local machine's
    Trusted People certificate store, then installs the package itself. This provides a complete
    installation experience in one command.
.PARAMETER PackagePath
    Path to the MSIX package file. If not specified, searches for .msix files in the current directory.
.PARAMETER CertPassword
    Password for the certificate if it's password-protected (optional).
.EXAMPLE
    .\install-msix.ps1
    .\install-msix.ps1 -PackagePath "winappcli_1.0.0.0_x64.msix"
